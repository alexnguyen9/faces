# faces

This project was an exercise on manipulating `pandas` dataframes, applying PCA methods, and applying the Random Forest algorithm. 

The Project consisted of 4 parts:

1. Importing the data
* Using data from the FaceScrub data, I imported and cleaned ~1500 images using the `OpenCV` library and applied them into a dataframe
2. Classifying Faces
* Applied various Random Forest Algorithms to train and predict the face image data to the correct person. Used PCA to improve computation speed and accuracy
3. Facial Recognition with Eigenfaces method
* Using PCA, applied the eigenface method to attempt to recognize an image is a face or not
4. Learning Gender
* Applied Random Forest to classify the person's gender.
