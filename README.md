# faces

This project was an exercise on manipulating `pandas` dataframes, applying PCA methods, and applying the Random Forest algorithm. 

The Project consisted of 4 parts:

## 1. Importing the data
* Using data from the FaceScrub data, I imported and cleaned ~1500 images using the `OpenCV` library and applied them into a dataframe
## 2. Classifying Faces
* Applied various Random Forest Algorithms to train and predict the face image data to the correct person. Used PCA to improve computation speed and accuracy
## 3. Facial Recognition with Eigenfaces method
* Using PCA, applied the eigenface method to attempt to recognize an image is a face or not
## 4. Learning Gender
* Applied Random Forest to classify the person's gender.
